# Relative Digital Identity Protocol

Identity is relative.

The Relative Digital Identity (RDIP) project offers an innovative solution that prioritizes security, anonymity, and data control in digital identity verification processes.

In modern society, digital identities allow individuals to securely identify themselves on online platforms, but existing authentication systems pose numerous risks to privacy and security. The RDIP project has developed a decentralized and flexible digital authentication protocol to address these issues.

For example, when you meet someone, you verify their name (identity) through other people.

Institutions exist through individuals.
Institutions provide services by placing individuals who have the authority to use their own data.
So, if we consider governments and similar structures as individuals that shere truth with an structure, only other individuals can verify you and others.

If there is no point of verification where someone can verify you, you could be just anyone.
This is the big picture, we dont have truth on "who is who?".

RDIP uses the relativity of identities and moves authentication logic away froms applications.
In RDIP, you will use a RDI Provider to identify yourself to others.
This means you won't be diffrent persons on different platforms.
This may seem bad from a privacy standpoint, but it's much better than others.
You will use who you trust, this solves the privacy point.

This is like using mail adresses but we move the verfication away.
This is fixes the "trust about identitiy" problem.
You reliey on the RDI provider, because thats the only job they had.
You can still verify user on your side if you want.

The problem we solve is "identitiy".
Who you are? Or who you become?
That's the "thing", human culture puts forward the individuals.

Who you are metters in human sens, RDIP fixes this.

There is no identity for computer, its a pice of metal and some silicon with a cuple fancy elements beside.
We need to deal with this in our ways.
The world never revolves around a single individual or institution. Humanity operates on the concept of distributed centrality.
Because of that, identitiy is reletive.
We develope RDIP for humanity.

We hope you undestand the vison.
