# Relative Digital Identity Protocol (RDIP)

Identity is relative.

The Relative Digital Identity (RDIP) project offers an innovative solution that prioritizes security, anonymity, and data control in digital identity verification processes.

In modern society, digital identities allow individuals to securely identify themselves on online platforms, but existing authentication systems pose numerous risks to privacy and security. The RDIP project has developed a decentralized and flexible digital authentication protocol to address these issues.

For example, when you meet someone, you verify their name (identity) through other people.

Institutions exist through individuals.
Institutions provide services by empowering individuals who have the authority to use their own data.
So, if we consider governments and similar structures as collections of individuals that share truth within a structure, only other individuals can verify you and others.

If there is no point of verification where someone can verify you, you could be just anyone.
This is the big picture: we don't have a shared truth on "who is who."

RDIP uses the relativity of identities and moves authentication logic away from applications.
In RDIP, you will use an RDI Provider to identify yourself to others.
This means you won't be different persons on different platforms.
This may seem bad from a privacy standpoint, but it's much better than the alternatives.
You will use those whom you trust; this solves the privacy concern.

This is like using email addresses, but we move the verification away.
This fixes the "trust about identity" problem.
You rely on the RDI provider because that is the only job they have.
You can still verify the user on your side if you want.

The problem we solve is "identity."
Who are you? Or who do you become?
That's the "thing"—human culture puts forward the individual.

Who you are matters in a human sense; RDIP fixes this.

There is no identity for a computer; it is a piece of metal and some silicon with a couple of fancy elements beside it.
We need to deal with this in our own way.
The world never revolves around a single individual or institution. Humanity operates on the concept of distributed centrality.
Because of that, identity is relative.
We develop RDIP for humanity.

We hope you understand the vision.
